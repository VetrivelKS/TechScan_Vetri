Templates:
I have use handlebars templates.
I have installed nodejs,npm,handlebars and have provided the "precompiled templates" in js/templates.js.

For further information:
http://handlebarsjs.com/precompilation.html

Styling:
I have used sassy css and pre-compiled them to css using ruby-compass.


There is no need of building the project again.
Hit "index.html". You are ready to go :)
